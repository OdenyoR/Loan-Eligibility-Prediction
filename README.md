# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

Loan Eligibility Prediction is a data science topic that focuses on predicting the likelihood of a loan applicant being approved for a loan. This is typically done by analyzing past loan applicant data and using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data that indicate whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved for a loan or not.

Using loan eligibility prediction can be useful for banks and other lending institutions when deciding whether to approve a loan applicant. By using predictive models, lenders can get a better understanding of the risk associated with a loan applicant and make better-informed decisions on whether to approve or reject loan applications. This can help banks and other lenders reduce their risk while still providing access to credit to those who need it. Additionally, lenders can use these predictive models to target certain segments of the population with loan offers, which can help increase their customer base and profits.
